# Notice to Our English-Speaking Users

Dear Visitors,

We extend our sincerest apologies as our website is currently available only in Norwegian. In our ongoing effort to provide the most accurate and timely information, we have found that maintaining bilingual content compromised the quality and reliability of our website.

Previously, our website operated with both English and Norwegian content. Unfortunately, this dual-language approach led to inconsistencies and outdated information, which did not meet our standards of quality. After careful consideration, we decided to focus on providing a single, more coherent version in Norwegian to enhance our information delivery.

While the reintroduction of English content is not currently planned, we remain open to feedback and will consider providing multilingual support if there is significant demand for it in the future. We appreciate your understanding and encourage you to share your views on this matter.

### Navigating Our Norwegian Content

For now, we suggest using translation tools such as Google Translate or Microsoft Translator for accessing our content in English. These tools are highly effective and can be used to translate our web pages automatically.

1. Google Translate: Visit [translate.google.com](https://translate.google.com/), enter our websiteâ€™s URL, and select Norwegian to English to view the translation.
2. Browser Built-in Translators: Modern browsers like Chrome or Edge usually offer an option to translate web pages automatically.

We value your support and understanding as we strive to provide the best possible information to all our users. If you have any questions or need further assistance, please feel free to contact us.

Thank you for your continued support,\
